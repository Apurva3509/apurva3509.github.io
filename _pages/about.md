Hi, 

I’m Apurva Patel, a recent MS graduate in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/electrical-engineering-department) from [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University) with a passion for Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Big Data. My journey spans developing cutting-edge solutions like an Autoencoder for 6G networks at Nokia and optimizing autonomous vehicle control systems using AI during my graduate research. With hands-on experience in NLP, LLM fine-tuning, and scalable AI solutions, I’m driven to bridge the gap between innovative technology and real-world impact. 

I am interested in roles involving Data Science & Analytics, Generative AI, AI Agents and Recomendation systems. Let’s [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patelapurva/) and collaborate!!
